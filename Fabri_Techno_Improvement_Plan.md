# Fabri-Techno Services Improvement Plan

## 1. Process Map (VSM)

### Overview of Workflow:
- **Sales Department:**
  - Receives customer requests via email or phone.
  - Prepares quotes and sends to customers.
  - Confirms orders and forwards to the Design Office.
  - **Lead Time:** 1-2 days (potential delays in follow-ups).
  - **Muda Identified:** Waiting, Overproduction.
  - **Lean Tools Applied:**
    - Implement CRM software to automate quotes (Kaizen).
    - Organize processes with "5S" methodology to reduce unnecessary steps.

- **Design Office (DO):**
  - Analyzes customer requirements from Sales.
  - Creates technical drawings and specification sheets.
  - Sends approved designs to Production.
  - **Lead Time:** 3-5 days (delays due to poor prioritization).
  - **Muda Identified:** Waiting.
  - **Lean Tools Applied:**
    - Use task management tools and priority queues (Kaizen).
    - Visualize bottlenecks with Value Stream Mapping (VSM).

- **Production Department:**
  - Uses designs to manufacture electronic components.
  - Conducts quality control checks for each product.
  - Sends finished goods to Logistics.
  - **Lead Time:** 5-7 days (affected by high waiting times and defects).
  - **Muda Identified:** Waiting, Defects, Motion, Overprocessing.
  - **Lean Tools Applied:**
    - Enhance quality control with "poka-yoke".
    - Align production with demand using "pull flow" system.

- **Logistics Department:**
  - Packages products and prepares for delivery.
  - Plans and tracks shipments.
  - Manages finished goods inventory.
  - **Lead Time:** 2-3 days (tracking and inventory losses cause delays).
  - **Muda Identified:** Inventory, Transportation.
  - **Lean Tools Applied:**
    - Implement "pull flow" system to align production with demand.
    - Digitize inventory and use GPS tracking for real-time monitoring (VSM).
    - Organize storage and workflow with "5S" methodology (5S). 

- **Support Services (After-Sales):**
  - Receives complaints and repair requests from customers.
  - Resolves issues by liaising with Production.
  - Monitors customer satisfaction through feedback surveys.
  - **Lead Time:** 3-7 days (long complaint processing times).
  - **Muda Identified:** Waiting, Overprocessing.
  - **Lean Tools Applied:**
    - Centralize complaints using ticketing software (Kaizen).
    - Standardize workflows to eliminate redundant processes (5S).

## 2. Lean Management Tools Applied:

- **Kaizen:** Continuous improvement actions to reduce delays and defects (Sales, Design Office, Support Services).
- **Value Stream Mapping (VSM):** Identify and eliminate waste in workflows (Design Office, Production).
- **Pull Flow System:** Align production with actual customer demand (Production, Logistics).
- **Poka-Yoke:** Implement error-proofing mechanisms to reduce defects (Production).
- **5S Methodology:** Organize workspaces to improve efficiency and minimize unnecessary movements (Sales, Logistics, Support Services).

## 4. Kaizen Plan (Improvement Actions):

| **Department**    | **Problem**                     | **Kaizen Action**                                               | **Priority** | **Expected Results**                                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sales             | Slow quote preparation          | Use CRM software to automate and track quote generation.        | High         | Faster response time to customer inquiries.                  |
| Sales             | Redundant processes             | Apply 5S methodology to standardize workflows.                  | Medium       | Eliminate unnecessary steps in customer interactions.         |
| Design Office     | Poor prioritization of tasks    | Implement priority queues and task management tools.            | High         | Reduced delays in design approvals.                          |
| Design Office     | Lack of visibility into delays  | Use VSM to identify and resolve bottlenecks.                    | High         | Improved workflow and prioritization.                        |
| Production        | High waiting times and defects  | Introduce Kanban boards and enhance quality control procedures. | High         | Shorter production cycles; fewer defects.                    |
| Production        | Unnecessary movements           | Apply pull flow system and poka-yoke mechanisms.                | Medium       | Reduced rework and aligned production schedules.             |
| Logistics         | Delayed deliveries and tracking | Use GPS-enabled shipment tracking and digitize inventory management. | Medium      | Improved delivery reliability.                               |
